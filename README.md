##  2. <a name='AboutTheProject'></a>About The Project

Built to list and describe all plugins that I've written that are installed on a particular wordpress installation.

![screenshot](https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__andyp-plugins/blob/master/files/screenshot.png?raw=true)

> This plugin requires [ACF Pro](https://advancedcustomfields.com/) to run.

This was also a good exercise in managing my custom plugins.

It works by having all of my plugins hitting a custom hook that triggers this manager. The plugin is then listed.

None Required.

##  5. <a name='Troubleshooting'></a>Troubleshooting

If you are getting a fatal error when activating, you probably haven't ran `composer install` which downloads `parsedown`.

```php
